# Elm-Tetris
An implementation of Tetris in the Elm Programming Language: A project for my functional programming class.

You can compile this project using the included Makefile by issuing the command "make". Elm compiles to JavaScript, so you can when run the resuling index.html file in a browser.

The controls are fairly simple, and use the arrow keys and the spacebar. The left and right arrow keys move the currently falling Tetromino in their respective directions, the up arrow key rotates the block, the down arrow key accellerates its falling speed and the spacebar swaps out the Tetromino with whatever is in the hold box.

This project was made with Elm v0.18. Elm is a very rapidly changing language at this point in time, so I can't guarantee how long this code will work with the current version of Elm.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
